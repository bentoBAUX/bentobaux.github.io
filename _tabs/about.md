**Hi! I’m Bennett Poh, a Computer Science student specialising in Games Engineering at the Technical University of Munich.** I have a deep passion for graphics programming and shader creation, and this site is where I document my projects and share my knowledge.  

I strive to explain complex topics in a way that’s clear, intuitive, and engaging—the way I wish I had learned them. Having faced these challenges myself, I want to make graphics programming more approachable for others, helping them not just understand but truly enjoy exploring these concepts.  

You can also find my **artworks, 3D renders, and past projects** on [ArtStation](https://www.artstation.com/bentobaux), and I showcase **shader demos, 3D animations, and level art timelapses** on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@bentobaux).

    I enjoy connecting with other developers, artists, and researchers in graphics programming.  
    If you'd like to collaborate, exchange ideas, or just chat about rendering, feel free to reach out on
