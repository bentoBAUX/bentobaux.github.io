Hi! Iâ€™m Bennett Poh, a Computer Science student specialising in Games Engineering at the Technical University of Munich. This site is where I document my projects and share my knowledge and passion for computer graphics. 

Here, I strive to explain complex topics the way I wish I had learned them: clear, intuitive, and engaging. Having faced these challenges myself, I aim to make graphics programming more approachable for others, helping them not just understand but truly enjoy exploring these concepts. 

All of my tutorials and learning resources will remain free to everyone. Should you ever want to say thanks, [**buying me a boba**](https://www.patreon.com/posts/buy-me-boba-138976168?utm_medium=clipboard_copy&utm_source=copyLink&utm_campaign=postshare_creator&utm_content=join_link) is a sweet way to do it. It also helps keep the content flowing! 

You can also find my **artworks, 3D renders, and past projects** on [ArtStation](https://www.artstation.com/bentobaux), and I showcase **shader demos, 3D animations, and level art timelapses** on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@bentobaux).
