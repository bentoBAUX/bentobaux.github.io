Hi! I am Bennett Poh, a computer science student specialising in games engineering, with a strong passion for graphics programming and shader creation. Here, you'll find my projects and their documentation, where I share my knowledge the way I wish I had learnedâ€”making complex topics clear, intuitive, and enjoyable. Having struggled with these concepts myself, I want to help others grasp them more easily and have fun exploring them.
