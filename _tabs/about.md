**Hi! I’m Bennett Poh, a Computer Science student specialising in Games Engineering at the Technical University of Munich.** I have a deep passion for graphics programming and shader creation, and this site is where I document my projects and share my knowledge.

I strive to explain complex topics in a way that’s clear, intuitive, and engaging—the way I wish I had learned them. Having faced these challenges myself, I want to make graphics programming more approachable for others, helping them not just understand but truly enjoy exploring these concepts.

If you're interested in my artworks, 3D renders, and past projects, check out my [ArtStation](https://www.artstation.com/bentobaux)-I haven't added them to this site yet, but they'll be here soon!

I also showcase demos of my shaders, 3D animations, level art timelapses, and more on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@bentobaux), so feel free to take a look!
