Featured in [**Raw Talent Booth @gamescom 2025**](https://rawtalentbooth.com), *Forgotten Colors* is a third-person puzzle-platformer set in a world where emotions shape reality. In this realm, those who cling too tightly to a single emotion risk losing their other ‚Äúcolours,‚Äù becoming ghosts bound to the physical world.

As a ghost binder, you must help Miyu recover her lost colours and guide her to the afterlife.

### **My Role**

As the sole artist and technical artist in our 8-person team, I was responsible for the entire visual direction of the game. My work included:
- **Capturing a sumi-e inspired style** and translating it into a cohesive 3D world.
- **Character design and modelling** for the game world.
- **Shader development** to achieve stylised visual effects.
- **Art direction and overall aesthetic cohesion** to support the game‚Äôs emotional themes.
- **Poster and graphic design** for marketing materials, including the official Gamescom 2025 showcase assets.

**üîó[Play on itch.io](https://bentobaux.itch.io/tail-as-old-as-time)**  

An exploration-driven puzzle game where you play as a curious cat uncovering the secrets of an ancient temple. True to a cat‚Äôs nature, there are no instructions or waypoints‚Äîonly the world itself to guide you. Every puzzle, every hidden path, and every strange mechanism invites you to observe, experiment, and intuit your way forward. 

What does that glowing symbol mean? Why does that stone shift when you step on it? Discovery is its own reward, as you slowly unravel the mystery surrounding the arcane sculpture at the heart of the temple.

This game is built to **demonstrate a custom [HLSL toon shader](/posts/basic-lighting-models-in-hlsl/#6-toon-shading)**, designed to bring **stylised lighting, vibrant contrast, and hand-crafted shading techniques** to life in a real-time environment.

### **Features**  
- **Exploration-driven gameplay**‚Äînavigate the temple using curiosity and observation.  
- **Environmental storytelling**‚Äîunravel the history behind the temple‚Äôs mysterious structures.  
- **Minimal UI, immersive experience**‚Äîno tutorials or guidance, just you and the world.

**üîó[Check out the Devpost](https://devpost.com/software/dialogues-through-time)**  

**Dialogues Through Time** is a project I developed with a friend during the **Microsoft AI Classroom Hackathon**, where we secured **2nd place**. I was primarily responsible for **world and game design**, and together we created an **AI-powered narrative experience** where players interact with historical figures. Through conversations, they gain insight into these figures' philosophies and personalities‚Äîas if they were still alive.  

The game follows a **narrative with a clear objective**: players must gather knowledge about humanity to convince a mysterious entity that civilisation is worth preserving‚Äîbefore it decides to erase everything.  

### Features  
- **AI-driven dialogue system** allowing interaction with historical figures.  
- **Branching narrative** based on player choices and gathered knowledge.  
- **Immersive storytelling** that blends history with speculative fiction.  
- **Dynamic responses** that create unique conversations in each playthrough.  

This project was built using **Microsoft AI technologies** (Azure OpenAI & Redis) to generate responsive and engaging dialogues, offering players an experience that feels both educational and thought-provoking.
